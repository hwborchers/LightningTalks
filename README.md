## Talks in 2020

## Planned Talks

* [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/)
  Classification and Regression Training  
  "Miscellaneous functions for training and plotting classification and regression models [...] to streamline the model training process for complex regression and classification problems."

* [regtools]()
  Regression and Classification Tools  
  "Tools for linear, nonlinear and nonparametric regression and classification. Novel graphical methods for assessment of parametric models using nonparametric methods."

* [lightgbm](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM)
  Light Gradient Boosting Machine  
  "LightGBM has been widely-used in many winning solutions of machine learning competitions. Comparison experiments on public datasets suggest that LightGBM can outperform existing boosting frameworks on both efficiency and accuracy, with significantly lower memory consumption."

* [xgboost]()
  Extreme Gradient Boosting  
  'xgboost' "is an efficient implementation of the gradient boosting framework from Chen & Guestrin. [...] The package includes efficient linear model solver and tree learning algorithms."
